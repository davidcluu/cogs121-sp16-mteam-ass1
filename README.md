## Heuristics
1. Visibility of system status
  * The user can see their post uploaded to the page after they press submit; an alert is not necessary because the feedback from the system is immediate.
2. Match between system and the real world
  * New items appear on towards the top of the application as older items move towards the bottom of the app.
3. User control and freedom
  * Users have the ability to delete comments and video posts
4. Consistency and standards
  * When the user wants to contribute to the application by making a Headline or Posting a Video, they post by clicking a "Submit" button for both actions.
5. Error
  * Users are prompted to confirm before they delete a post or comment.
6. Recognition rather than recall
  * When the user clicks a headline to view related videos, the corresponding headline is also displayed to the user on the right in the Incoming News panel.
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
  * When the user logs in, they have access to all of the features (comment, posting, deleting, etc) whereas a user without an account has limited access to features (viewing).
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
  * Form placeholders give enough information to prompt the user to input the correct type of data in the corresponding input fields.
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
  * JavaScript Alerts notify the user to an error when one occurs (e.g. Cannot post a video because the user is not logged in)
10. Help and documentation
  * There is a help page under the user menu that explains how to use the iWitness News app.
